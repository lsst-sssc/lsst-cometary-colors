# June 2023 SSSC Readiness Sprint

Cyrielle Opitom, Carrie Holt, Tim Lister, Mike Kelley

## Review project status

Cyrielle:
* Spectra of a couple comets to use: 103P, C/2013 US10 over a range of heliocentric distances.
* Fit the spectra with the PSG
* Dust model is Afρ.
* PSG has added NH2 since last time we met.  Just missing CH.

Tim:
* Was trying to use the PSG API.
* Using a generalized ETC that takes a spectrum a system throughput as an input.  Includes telluric contributions.

Mike:
* Modeling photometry via Haser models and Afρ.
* Missing OH model, and a few bands, notably C2 delta-nu+/-1, red CN bands.

## Goals

* Carrie: getting spectra from Cyrielle and running through Tim's ETC.
* Cyrielle: getting updated spectral fits with the PSG.
* Tim: Reviewing PSG API and config files.
* Mike: Debugging photometry code to produce reliable fluxes.
